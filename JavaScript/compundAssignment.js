// In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

// myVar = myVar + 5;

// to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

// One such operator is the += operator.


var a = 3;
var  b= 17;
var c= 12;


a+=12;
b+=9;
c+=7;

//same goes to subtraction

var x = 11;
var y= 19;
var z= 12;

x-=6;
y-=9;
z-=2;

/// and MultiplicationPassed
var x1 = 11;
var y1= 19;
var z1= 12;

x1*=2;
y1*=3;
z1*=4;
//Division 

var x2 = 11;
var y2= 19;
var z2= 12;

x2/=3;
y2/=9;
z2/=3;
